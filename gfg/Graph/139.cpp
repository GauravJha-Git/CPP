/*
ðŸ“Œ Question:
Given a connected undirected graph containing V vertices, represented by a 2-d adjacency list adj[][],
where each adj[i] represents the list of vertices connected to vertex i.
Perform a Breadth First Search (BFS) traversal starting from vertex 0, visiting vertices from left to right 
according to the given adjacency list, and return a list containing the BFS traversal of the graph.

Note: Do traverse in the same order as they are in the given adjacency list.

---

ðŸ”¹ Example 1:
Input: adj = [[2, 3, 1], [0], [0, 4], [0], [2]]
Output: 0 2 3 1 4

Explanation:
Start from 0 â†’ [0]
Visit neighbors of 0 â†’ [2,3,1] â†’ [0,2,3,1]
Visit 4 (neighbor of 2) â†’ [0,2,3,1,4]

---

ðŸ”¹ Example 2:
Input: adj = [[1, 2], [0, 2], [0, 1, 3, 4], [2], [2]]
Output: 0 1 2 3 4

---

ðŸ“Œ Approach:
1. Use a queue (FIFO) for BFS traversal.
2. Maintain a visited[] array to avoid revisiting nodes.
3. Start BFS from node 0:
   - Push 0 into queue and mark as visited.
   - While queue is not empty:
        - Pop front node from queue.
        - Add it to result.
        - Traverse all its unvisited neighbors (in given order),
          mark visited, and push into queue.
4. Return the traversal order.

ðŸ“Œ Explanation:
BFS explores vertices level by level.
- From 0, visit all neighbors first.
- Then visit their neighbors.
- Continue until all nodes are visited.

ðŸ“Œ Code Explanation:
1. vector<bool> visited(V,false) â†’ keeps track of visited vertices.
2. queue<int> q â†’ BFS uses queue to explore nodes in order.
3. Start with 0: mark visited, push into queue.
4. While queue not empty:
   - Pop front â†’ add to result.
   - For each neighbor of node:
       - If not visited â†’ mark visited & push to queue.
5. Return traversal result.
