  âœ… Question: Longest Palindromic Subsequence

  Given a string `s`, return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in it.

  - A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived by deleting some or no characters without changing the order.
  - A palindromic subsequence is one that reads the same forwards and backwards.

  Examples:
    Input: s = "bbabcbcab"
    Output: 7
    Explanation: "babcbab" is the longest palindromic subsequence.

    Input: s = "abcd"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: All characters are palindromes of length 1.

    Input: s = "agbdba"
    Output: 5
    Explanation: "abdba" is the longest palindromic subsequence.

  Constraints:
    1 <= s.length <= 1000
    s contains only lowercase English letters.

/*
  ðŸ§  Approach:

  We use Dynamic Programming (DP).
  Let dp[i][j] represent the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in s[i...j].

  - If s[i] == s[j], then dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1]
  - Else, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])

  We build the DP table from shorter substrings to longer substrings.

// Class that contains the function to solve the problem

    int longestPalinSubseq(string &s) {
        int n = s.size();

        // Create a 2D DP table initialized to 0
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));

        // Every character is a palindrome of length 1
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            dp[i][i] = 1;

        // Fill the table for substrings of length 2 to n

            for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;

                }
